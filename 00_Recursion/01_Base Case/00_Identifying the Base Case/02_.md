Did you receive an output of six? The program is working as intended because three factorial is equal to six. If we take a look at what happens in the method step by step, we see that the `if` statement is the "base case".

1. `factorial(3)`
2. `result = factorial(2) * 3;`
3. `factorial(2)`
4. `result = factorial(1) * 2;`
5. `factorial(1)`
6. `return 1;`
7. `result = 1 * 2;`
8. `return result;` (result is 2)
9. `result = 2 * 3;`
10. `return result;` (result is 6)

Line four and seven, two and nine are referring to the same line of code. This is because the `return` statement can't be called until `factorial(2)` and `factorial(1)` returned a number.
