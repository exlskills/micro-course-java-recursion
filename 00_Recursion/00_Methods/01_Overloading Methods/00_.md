In Java, the concept of "overloading" is when two or more methods of a class have the same name but different "parameter lists". In this special case, when a method is called, the program calls the correct method by checking the parameters. To understand this concept further, let's think back to when we were working with the `Math` class. When we used the method `Math.abs()`, we experienced the concept of overloading as the method had four different choices for the parameter; the data types `int`, `double`, `float`, and `long`. Let's dive into how we can overload a method.
