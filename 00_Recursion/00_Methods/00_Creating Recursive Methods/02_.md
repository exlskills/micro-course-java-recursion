Recursion means that within the course of the method body, there is a statement that calls the same method as the method it belongs in. To prevent a repeating loop from occurring, every recursive method has a "base case" which exits the method when the method is complete.

In the method above, the base case is the `if` statement because the method will stop when `parameterOne` is less than 0. Let's track what happens when the method is called.

1. `print(10);`
2. `System.out.println(10 + " ");`
3. `parameterOne--;`
4. `print(9);`
5. `System.out.println(9 + " ");`
6. `print(8);`

 and so on until the boolean expression in the `if` statement evaluates to false.
