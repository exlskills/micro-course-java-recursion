>>Under which of these conditions is it appropriate to overload a method? <<

(x) The methods have a different number of parameters or a different data type for the parameter. {{Correct because overloading is necessary when two functions perform the same operation but takes in a different number of parameters or a different data type for the parameters.}}
( ) The methods have different functions. {{Incorrect because methods that have different functions should be named differently.}}
( ) The methods have different parameter names. {{Incorrect because the parameter names are not important, only the number of parameters are.}}
( ) The methods have different post-conditions. {{Incorrect because methods with different post-conditions will have different functions and should be named differently.}}
( ) Two methods with the same name can never be included in the same class. {{Incorrect because two methods can have the same name as long as the number of parameters or the data type of parameters are different.}}

||<code>Math.abs()</code> is an example of overloading a method. ||
